XCB-2024-top

--- REV A
Initial prototype

--- REV B
- Silkscreen: REV A -> REV B
- Silkscreen: Removed "JLCJLCJLCJLC" marker (panel has marking)
- Silkscreen: SIO -> SWDIO
- Silkscreen: CLK -> SWDCLK
- Silkscreen: RES -> nRST
- Silkscreen: Removed "kiu" marking
- Silkscreen: Switch RX+TX
- Silkscreen: Added 38400
- Reduced size of RX+TX testpoints
- Removed mounting cutout for clip (xcb-2024-bottom has cutout)
- Removed Testpoints VCC + GND (available via 6P connector)
- Removed LCD_READ (not used)
- Reduced LCD_DATA from PA6 + PA7 to PA7 only
- Removed Solder Bridges for touch ICs (permanently tied LHO to VCC, OHO to GND)
- Removed Solder Bridge for Boot0 (permanently tied to GND via 4k7)
- Added 3V3 LDO (for USB power)
- Updated Buzzer footprint (pad spacing)
- Replaced flimsy switch with C160878
- Move LCD_WRITE 11/PA5->12/PA6 (Buzzer needs timer on 10/PA4)
- Move LCD_CS 10/PA4->11/PA5 (Buzzer needs timer on 10/PA4)
- Move BUZZ 3/PF1->10/PA4 (Buzzer needs timer on 10/PA4)
- Move SENSOR_VCC 2/PF0->7/PA1 (Better ground access)
- Move MODE_CONF 26/PB3->22/PA12 (IR TX needs timer on 28/PB5)
- Move BTN_TL 27/PB4->26/PB3 (IR TX needs timer on 28/PB5)
- Move BTN_BL 28/PB5->27/PB4 (IR TX needs timer on 28/PB5)
- Move IR_TX 23/PA13->28/PB5 (IR TX needs timer on 28/PB5)
- Updated Logo footprint (cleaner)
- Added TX to 6p connector
- Moved IR TX resistor to top
- Reduced VLCD resistor from 4k7 to 330
- Set Buzzer resistor to 2x330-->165
- Set IR TX resistor to 330
